#### adaptiveui-cable

Cable is a messaging utility with tree and graph message broadcasting combining the centricity of mediators with the semantic protections of signal-slot.

## Install

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install --save adaptiveui-cable
```

Install with bower.

```sh
bower install --save adaptiveui-cable
```

### Lodash Dependency

This library requires a small set of lodash. Use [lodash-modularize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-modularize) to limit how much of lodash is included in your project.

## Quick Usage

```js
import Cable from "adaptiveui-cable"

const cable = new Cable();

cable.channel('opened');
cable.channel('closed');

cable.closed.subscribe(function(a, b) {
  assert(a === 'info');
}).publish('info');
```

## Usage

### Cable API

#### Initializing

A cable object is Mediator. It is a hub for messaging multiple events along channels.

```javascript
const cable = new Cable();
```

The `Cable` object takes the following configuration properties.

| Property       | Type        | Default Value | Purpose                                                    |
|:---------------|:------------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `asynchronous` | __boolean__ | `true`        | All publish calls happen after the current stack has ended |

#### Channels

A `Cable` object is a signal which can have slots (methods to invoke) attached to it. Every channel defined on a `Cable` creates a new `Cable` with a `channelName`.

> A `Cable` improves reliability because each exists as an object; there is less chance of a communication break down.

```javascript
cable.channel('initialized');
cable.channel('opened');
cable.channel('closed');
assert(cable.closed instanceof Cable);
```

Cables can be built into communication hierarchies, so that published messages at the top of the communication tree propagate down or up the channel tree.

```javascript
cable.channel('chat:send');
cable.channel('chat:startup');
cable.channel('chat:shutdown');
cable.channel('file/send');
cable.channel('file/startup');
cable.channel('file/shutdown');
```

The characters `/`, `.`, `:` can be used to split channel strings. Whichever you choose must be used through the entire channel string. You cannot define a channel with different split characters like `a/b:c.d`, but `a.b.c.d` or `a:b:c:d` or `a/b/c/d`.

#### Messaging

There are three directions messages can be passed in the hierarchy: up, across, and down.

| Direction | Method      |
|:----------|:------------|
| Up        | `emit`      |
| Across    | `publish`   |
| Down      | `broadcast` |

To invoke all subscribers that the cable has a hierarchical relationship with you would call:

```javascript
cable.emit()      // invoke subscribers on parent cables
cable.publish()   // invoke subscribers on cable
cable.broadcast() // invoke subscribers on child cables
```

#### Publishing

Once a cable channel is defined we can publish messages. You can send as many parameters as needed.

```javascript
cable.channel('opened');
cable.opened.publish('p1', 'p2');
```

If a channel hierarchy is defined, then it is important to understand the difference between publishing, emitting, and broadcasting.

We will define component validation events.

```javascript
cable.channel('component:form:text:validate');
cable.channel('component:form:select:validate');
cable.channel('component:form:radio:validate');
cable.channel('component:form:checkbox:validate');
```

We can validate each component by looping over the types of form components.

```javascript
_.each(cable.component.form, function(type) {
  type.validate.publish();
});
```

#### Broadcasting

While a `publish` will invoke all subscribes on a `Cable`, a broadcast will invoke all subscribers on all channels (i.e. children cables) on that cable, indefinitely.

The loop above which published to all validation methods could be re-written as the following with a `broadcast`.

```javascript
cable.component.form.broadcast();
```

If we define four nested `Cable` objects (i.e. four channels) we can invoke each of these manually.

```javascript
cable.channel('p1.p2.p3.p4');   // Equal(1)
cable.p1.publish('1');          // Equal(2)
cable.p1.p2.publish('1');       // Equal(3)
cable.p1.p2.p3.publish('1');    // Equal(3)
cable.p1.p2.p3.p4.publish('1'); // Equal(3)
```

We can accomplish the same with the following; notice that `broadcast` does not call the current cable's subscribers.

```javascript
cable.channel('p1.p2.p3.p4');   // Equal(1)
cable.p1.publish('1');          // Equal(2)
cable.p1.broadcast('1');        // Equal(3)
```

#### Emitting

Emitting sends messages from a cable to all of it's parents, but similar to broadcasting it does not invoke subscribers on the `Cable`.

#### Subscribing

We want to respond to messages sent. The `subscribe` object mirrors the `publish` object; every channel exists on the `subscribe` object.

```javascript
cable.channel('closed');
cable.closed.subscribe(function(v) {
  assert(v === 1);
}).publish(1);
```

As many subscribers can be added to any channel. A subscription also works like _slots_, where the object and method are provided and not just a function.

```javascript
const component = {
  onClosed() {}
};

cable.closed.subscribe(component, 'onClosed');
cable.closed.subscribe(component, component.onClosed);
```

A child subscriber will be called either by a direct publisher call or a parent broadcast.

```javascript
cable.channel('component/select/closed');
cable.component.subscribe(function(v) { /* will be called */ });
cable.component.select.subscribe(function(v) { /* will be called */ });
cable.component.select.closed.subscribe(function(v) { /* will be called */ });
cable.component.publish('send to only components');
cable.component.broadcast.publish('send to all components and child channels');
```

#### Bridging

Bridging is a mechanism to create graphs of messaging inside of a cable or spanning multiple cables.

```javascript
cable.channel('a.b.c.d');
cable.channel('w.x.y.z');

cable.bridge('a.b', 'w');

// this will call subscribers on a, a.b, w, w.x, w.x.y, w.x.y.z
cable.a.broadcast();
```

Two different cable objects can be bridged so messages in one will trigger subscribers in the other.

```javascript
cable1.channel('a.b.c.d');
cable2.channel('w.x.y.z');

cable1.bridge('a.b', cable2.lookup('w.x'));

cable2.w.x.subscribe(function() { /* will be called */ });
cable1.a.b.publish();
```

Channels can be chained in graphs as well as tree structures.

```javascript
cable1.channel('A');
cable2.channel('B');

cable1.bridge('A', cable2.B);
cable2.bridge('B', cable1.A);

cable2.B.subscribe(function() { /* will be called */ });
cable1.A.publish();

cable1.A.subscribe(function() { /* will be called */ });
cable2.B.publish();
```
