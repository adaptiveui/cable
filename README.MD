#### adaptiveui-cable

Cable is a messaging utility with tree and graph message broadcasting combining the centricity of mediators with the semantic protections of signal-slot.

## Install

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install --save adaptiveui-cable
```

Install with bower.

```sh
bower install --save adaptiveui-cable
```

### Lodash Dependency

This library requires a small set of lodash. Use [lodash-modularize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-modularize) to limit how much of lodash is included in your project.

## Quick Usage

```js
import Cable from "adaptiveui-cable"

const cable = Cable();

cable.channel('opened');
cable.channel('closed');

cable.subscribe.closed(function(a, b) {
  assert(a === 'info');
});
cable.publish.closed('info');
```

## Usage

### Cable API

#### Initializing

A cable object is Mediator. It is a hub for messaging multiple events along channels.

```javascript
const cable = Cable();
```

#### Channels

Every message sent on `Cable` must be through a pre-defined channel. Every channel creates a signal function which traps all of the listeners (slots) attached to it.

> A signal is improves reliability because they exist as objects, so there is less chance of communication breaking down

```javascript
cable.channel('initialized');
cable.channel('opened');
cable.channel('closed');
```

Channels can be built into communication hierarchies, so that published messages at the top of the communication tree propagate down the channel tree.

```javascript
cable.channel('chat-send');
cable.channel('chat-startup');
cable.channel('chat-shutdown');
cable.channel('file/send');
cable.channel('file/startup');
cable.channel('file/shutdown');
```

The characters `/`, `.`, `-`, `:` can be used to split channel strings. Which ever you choose must be used through the entire channel string.

#### Publishing

Once a channel is defined we can publish messages. You can send as many parameters as needed.

```javascript
cable.channel('opened');
cable.publish.opened('p1', 'p2');
```

If a channel hierarchy is defined, then it is important to understand the difference between messaging and broadcasting.

We will define component validation events.

```javascript
cable.channel('component:form:text:validate');
cable.channel('component:form:select:validate');
cable.channel('component:form:radio:validate');
cable.channel('component:form:checkbox:validate');
```

We can validate each component by looping over the types of form components.

```javascript
// invoke each validation method
_.each(cable.publish.component.form, function(type) {
  type.validate();
});
```

##### Publishing Hierarchy

Every channel parent can be published on. You can:

- publish to a parent channel only
- publish to a parent channel and all children

To publish on any channel, but not propagate the message down, just invoke any channel on `publish`.

```javascript
cable.channel('p1.p2.p3.p4');
cable.publish.p1('1');
cable.publish.p1.p2('2');
cable.publish.p1.p2.p3('2');
cable.publish.p1.p2.p3.p4('2');
```

If you want to publish to the parent and all children, you need to `broadcast`. The following is the same as the code above.

```javascript
cable.channel('p1.p2.p3.p4');
cable.publish.p1.broadcast('1');
```

#### Subscribing

We want to respond to messages sent. The `subscribe` object mirrors the `publish` object; every channel exists on the `subscribe` object.

```javascript
cable.channel('closed');
cable.subscribe.closed(function(v) {
  assert(v === 1);
})
cable.publish.closed(1);
```

As many subscribers can be added to any channel. A subscription also works like _slots_, where the object and method are provided and not just a function.

```javascript
const component = {
  onClosed() {}
};

cable.subscribe.closed(component, 'onClosed');
cable.subscribe.closed(component, component.onClosed);
```

A child subscriber will be called either by a direct publisher call or a parent broadcast.

```javascript
cable.channel('component/select/closed');
cable.subscribe.component(function(v) { /* will be called */ });
cable.subscribe.component.select(function(v) { /* will be called */ });
cable.subscribe.component.select.closed(function(v) { /* will be called */ });
cable.publish.component('send to only components');
cable.publish.component.broadcast('send to all components and child channels');
```

#### Bridging

Bridging is a mechanism to create graphs of messaging inside of a cable or spanning multiple cables.

```javascript
cable.channel('a.b.c.d');
cable.channel('w.x.y.z');

cable.bridge('a.b', 'w');

// this will call subscribers on a, a.b, w, w.x, w.x.y, w.x.y.z
cable.publish.a.broadcast();
```

Two different cable objects can be bridged so messages in one will trigger subscribers in the other.

```javascript
cable1.channel('a.b.c.d');
cable2.channel('w.x.y.z');

cable1.bridge('a.b', cable2.publish('w.x'));

cable2.subscribe.w.x(function() { /* will be called */ });
cable1.publish.a.b();
```

Channels can be chained in graphs as well as tree structures.

```javascript
cable1.channel('A');
cable2.channel('B');

cable1.bridge('A', cable2.publish.B);
cable2.bridge('B', cable1.publish.A);

cable2.subscribe.B(function() { /* will be called */ });
cable1.publish.A();

cable1.subscribe.A(function() { /* will be called */ });
cable2.publish.B();
```
